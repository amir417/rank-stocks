Rank Stocks (rankstocks.com)
Idea:
The idea of the website is to ask users what they thing of listed stocks and rank the stocks
based on user rankings. The aim of the website is to help investors validate their ideas
towards a certain stock by looking at what others think of the website. If an investor think
highly of a stock but everyone else believes otherwise, they will have to be more careful with
their investments.





Features:
● The website will list all stocks listed on Nasdaq.
● It will let users express their ideas about any stocks they prefer.
● It will ask for the user’s prediction on different criteria on how the stock will
perform. Will ask the user for:
○ The price target for a month, 6 months, and a year from now.
○ If they own the stock and how much (will be private for the user)
○ Prediction for the stock’s upcoming esp
○ Rank growth
○ Rank profitability
○ Rank valuation (overvalued or undervalued?)
○ And much more


To validate if the investor is a legitimate investor, their prediction will be compared with the
real outcome to see how accurate their predictions were. This will allow the website to rank
the investors based on their performance. Thus, investors with higher creditability will be
ranked higher and their opinion will matter more.
The website will list the investors with the highest credibility and those who are consistently
wrong will lose the ability to rank any stock after a certain point. (for example, if the investors
are ranked from 1-10, those whose ranking falls below 2 will no longer have the ability to
share their prediction and those with a 10 will be valued the most.)
After asking those of friend of mine who regularly invest in the stock market, I came to the
conclusion that the current websites (listed below) only use well-known analysts who in most
case are not trustable since their opinion is highly influenced by their personal benefits and
whoever pays them the most for a recommendation.
People are interested to know what other discretionary investors think which is much less
manipulated.
